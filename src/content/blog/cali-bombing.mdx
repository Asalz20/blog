# Cali Bombings 2025: Echoes of the Past, Voices of the Present

> _“Why are there still bombs going off in Colombia in 2025? Is Colombia becoming as dangerous as it was in the 80s and 90s?”_

That was the question I found myself asking, alongside many others, after **August 21st, 2025**. On that Thursday, a truck loaded with two large cylinder bombs detonated outside the **Marco Fidel Suárez military aviation school** in Cali.
The explosion killed **six people** and left **over 80 injured**.[^elpais]

Authorities later confirmed a second truck filled with gas canisters was discovered and safely neutralized. Meanwhile, in Antioquia, an explosive-laden drone brought down a police Black Hawk helicopter, killing more than a dozen officers in the same 24-hour window.[^reuters]

President **Gustavo Petro**[^petro] quickly pointed to dissident factions of the **FARC**[^farc]—notably the **Estado Mayor Central (EMC)**[^emc] and the **Carlos Patiño Front**—as responsible. The government launched **Operation Sultana**, a security surge aimed at tracking high-value targets and restoring calm.[^lemonde]

## Cali’s Unfortunate Geography

Cali isn’t just Colombia’s third-largest city; it’s a city caught in the crosshairs of geography. It sits just north of **El Cauca**[^cauca], one of the most entrenched drug-producing regions, and only two hours from **Buenaventura**, Colombia’s most important Pacific port.[^buenaventura]

That means contraband flows here. And when the state pushes back, guerrilla remnants and narco-armed groups strike Cali—it’s the closest big target.

## A Century of Conflict, A Cycle That Endures

Colombia’s violence isn’t new. For over **100 years**, the country has endured political conflict between left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.

The **cocaine boom of the 70s and 80s** changed everything. Once armed groups discovered drug profits, they gained money, weapons, and endless recruits. Some still cloak themselves in political rhetoric, but many operate openly as cartels.

The playbook hasn’t changed much: when the military conducts raids, the response is often **retaliatory bombings or attacks** in urban centers.

## Everyday Resilience vs. Global Pause

Talking to locals after the bombing, one distinction struck me.

**In the U.S.,** when there is a mass shooting or terrorist attack, life often stops. News coverage overwhelms the airwaves, vigils form, schools close, and communities pour resources into grieving.

**But in Cali?** The next morning, the arepa mixtas cart vendor simply moved her stand one block over. Shops reopened. Buses ran. People didn’t pause—they couldn’t.

As _El País_ reported, neighborhoods like La Base woke up “militarized” yet still bustling, with families cleaning up rubble and thanking God they were alive.[^elpais-after]

This isn’t denial—it’s resilience. Psychologists call it **contextual flexibility**: adapting to trauma because life leaves no choice.[^bonanno]

As someone of **caleño descent**, I felt torn. I was proud of this resilience—yet grieving, knowing many have no luxury to dwell in pain. Their focus is their next meal, their next sale, keeping their children fed. Life doesn’t stop here; it pushes forward, always.

## Are We Back in the 80s and 90s?

This is the central question. The bombs, the casualties, the fear—it feels like history repeating itself.

Yet, there are differences:

- Violence today is fragmented, carried out by smaller splinter groups rather than the monolithic cartels of the past.
- The Colombian state is stronger, with more intelligence capacity and international partnerships.
- Civil society and global attention provide a different kind of accountability.

But for the people of Cali, distinctions matter little when another bomb rocks their streets.

## Closing Reflections

The resilience of Cali’s people is both inspiring and heartbreaking.
Where others would stop, Cali keeps moving.
