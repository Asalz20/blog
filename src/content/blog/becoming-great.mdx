# Inspired by the works of Joe Dispenza, Barbara Oakley, and Jeffrey Ford, this piece breaks down seven habits that can help step into your own greatness.

## Habit 1: Start Actually Listening

Don't just listen waiting to speak, be active while you're listening. really try to tune out the voices in your head that will distract you from what is actually being said.

## Habit 2: Read & Communicate More

Ironically, while Habit 1 teaches listening, this habit urges you to speak up once you've done your research. reading widely expands your perspectives, refines your thinking, and enriches your language. Then, practice being precise with your thoughts by being explicit and exact with your language. Good communication is a skill; the more you do it, the sharper it becomes.

## Habit 3: Take care of your Health

Your mind's strength is linked to your body's vitality. Physical well-being, exercise, proper nutrition, and quality sleep fuels mental clarity and resilience. Prioritzing physical health as much as your mental helath will show you growth in everything you do, tenfold.

## Habit 4: Daydream More

Jeffrey Ford says "Daydreams are the precursor to every invention". You cannot be on 100% at all times. Let your mind wander, entertain the nonsense from life. Barbara Oakley calls this the "diffused mode" of thinking-where your mind sorts things out in the background. Also, get your 8 hours of sleep in, seriously. You need that downtime.

## Habit 5: Think For yourself

You can drink from the firehose and consume infinite media, but if you never question what's being shoved in your face, you're just parroting. Ask yourself why you're being shown this or told that. Then question it again. And again.

## Habit 6: Find your Tribe

There will always be people who know more than you about something-and that's great news. Hang around them, learn from them. And share what you know, too. We grow together.

## Habit 7: Have a peaceful place to work

Ideas need nurturing to flourish. Create an envrionment-your personal sancturary-where you can focus without fear or distraction. Even the smallest seedling will not grow in a desolate hellscape.

## Conclusion

Growth isn't about suddent leaps; it's about steady, and mindful progress. Cultivate these habits and watch how your thinking, creativity, and resilience begin to transform. The more you engage, reflect, and refine, the closer you move toward becoming truly "great".
